            <p>This is a thick (12 gauge) and very sturdy cube. Most stainless steel products are far thinner (14, 16, and 18 gauge). The difference between 12 and 14 gauge is substantial. This will potentially last for generations. Your great grandkids could give this to their grandkids.</p>
            <p>Any size can be requested. Common sizes are 16 inch, 20 inch, or 16 x 16 x 32.</p>
            <p>This piece is completely hand crafted. It is all one piece and it is completely enclosed with no holes or seams. It has very smooth corners and edges. Perfect for home interior or exterior design. Custom sizes can be requested including rectangular cubes.</p>
            <p>These are made to order, and it may take up to 2 weeks to ship. Shipping within the U.S. is free!!! Check back for new products soon.</p>
